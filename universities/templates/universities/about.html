                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>College Dreaming is a website built during our team's senior year (2020-2021) at the
                    University of Cincinnati. Its main goal is to provide a more personalized and
                    holistic approach to the college search. With that being said, anyone can use
                    this website, though it is targeted towards high school students and their families
                    or adults who are looking to obtain another degree, obtain their first degree, or just take
                        a few classes alongside work. <strong>Please note:</strong> College Dreaming is for educational purposes
                    only and is not a business entity. It is purely meant to meet the requirements to graduate
                    from the University of Cincinnati.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Maps integration</strong> - Allows you to virtually explore the
                surrounding area of a university/college. Letting you get an
                understanding of the type of environment surrounding a university/college.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quiz Feature</strong> - Provides a more engaging and interactive college
                search. Instead of searching for a specific university or checking off on
                specific keywords, you will be presented with questions pertaining to
                potential interests and the result will be a university that accurately
                represents the interests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Search Functionality</strong> - If you already know what universities/colleges
                you are interested in but canâ€™t seem to find all of the information in one
                place, you are able to search for a specific university/college and
                see all of the standard data pertaining to that university/college and
                non-standard data. A sample could be ACT/SAT scores, tuition, potential earnings
                after graduation, student demographics, nearby attractions, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced Search Functionality</strong> - This allows you to put weights
                on different variables related to a university/college such as crime,
                tuition, major, and much more. When you are done inputting your
                weights, a list of potential matches will appear that you can
                then click on and see more details.
