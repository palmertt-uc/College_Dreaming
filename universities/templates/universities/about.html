                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>College Dreaming is a website built during our team's senior year (2020-2021) at the
                            University of Cincinnati. Its main goal is to provide a more personalized and
                            holistic approach to the college search. With that being said, anyone can use
                            this website, though it is targeted towards high school students and their families
                            or adults who are looking to obtain another degree, obtain their first degree, or just take
                            a few classes alongside work. <strong>Please note:</strong> College Dreaming is for
                            educational purposes
                            only and is not a business entity. It is purely meant to meet the requirements to graduate
                            from the University of Cincinnati.</p>

                    potential interests and the result will be a university that accurately

                    you are interested in but canâ€™t seem to find all of the information in one
                    place, you are able to search for a specific university/college and
                    see all of the standard data pertaining to that university/college and
                    non-standard data. A sample could be ACT/SAT scores, tuition, potential earnings
                    after graduation, student demographics, nearby attractions, etc.
